## Slide 4 of 18

# “[T]he underlying capability of the computer era is actually programming—which almost none of us know how to do. We simply use the programs that have been made for us, and enter our text in the appropriate box on the screen. We teach kids how to use software to write, but not how to write software. This means they have access to the capabilities given to them by others, but not the power to determine the value-creating capabilities of these technologies for themselves.”

*Douglas Rushkoff: Capabilities*

# Facebook Account

### Speaker Notes
Facebook continues to resolve users’ genders into a binary: either “male” or “female.” Evidently, this decision was made so that Facebook could allow its primary clients—advertisers—to more easily market to one gender or the other. Put another way, even if you can choose the gender that you show to your Facebook friends, you can’t change the gender that Facebook provides to its paying customers (figure 4.3). https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/h1w0nbqp/release/3

# Positive Voices Survey

### Speaker Notes
One recent alternative to the binary, developed by Public Health England in collaboration with LGBTQ+ organizations in the United Kingdom, is in evidence in figure 4.5. This two-item questionnaire was designed for use in routine national surveillance of HIV in England and Wales to determine self-identified gender and cis or trans status in a public health context. The designers offer three named genders, a catch-all fourth category, and an option for not disclosing gender identity. In a separate question, they ask about gender at birth, again giving an option for not disclosing. The survey design uses sensitive wording and inclusive terminology to allow trans and genderqueer populations to be counted. These questions are being considered for expanded use across other national health records and data collection systems in the United Kingdom. https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/h1w0nbqp/release/3
