                    <div class="policy-section">
                        <h2>üíª System Requirements</h2>
                        <p>Throughout the semester, you will be doing extensive coding in Python. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the necessary hardware to do this.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Computer & Internet</h3>
                        <p>You must have access to a reliable computer and internet connection that meets the TCU Online minimum requirements.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Required Platforms</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>TCU Online:</strong> Required for this class</li>
                            <li><strong>Google Account:</strong> Needed for Google Drive and Google Colab (our primary coding environment)</li>
                            <li><strong>TCU Email:</strong> Only official TCU student email will be used for course notifications</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Generative AI Policy</h3>
                        <p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology (Google Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) is <strong>permitted and encouraged</strong> for your use in this class, provided that you document in detail any and all uses of the technology through descriptive notes (# comments in your code).</p>
                        <p><em>Note: Inappropriate or unauthorized use of AI-generated content may be academic misconduct and will be handled according to TCU's Academic Conduct Policy.</em></p>

                    <!-- Grading Philosophy -->
                    <div class="policy-section">
                        <h2>üìä Grading Philosophy: "Un-grading"</h2>
                        <p>In this class, we won't be grading individual assignments or calculating points/percentages. Instead, we'll offer lots of feedback without any points or letter grades‚Äîbut we will indicate if you are meeting expectations.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How It Works</h3>
                        <p>Throughout the semester, you will write three self-reflection essays (about a page each) on how you've developed as a learner. On the second and third essays, you will indicate the grade you believe you have earned. These will determine your midterm and final letter grades.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why Un-grading?</h3>
                        <p>This approach focuses on learning rather than performance, encouraging deeper engagement with the material. For more information, we recommend Jesse Stommel's blog posts: "Why I Don't Grade" and "How to Ungrade."</p>
                        
                        <h3>Grading Scale</h3>
                        <div class="grade-scale">
                            <div class="grade-row">

                    <!-- Attendance Policy -->
                    <div class="policy-section">
                        <h2>üìÖ Attendance & Tardiness</h2>
                        <p>In keeping with our "un-grading" policy, we will not take official attendance nor deduct points for missed classes or late arrivals. However, the class moves quickly, and missing content affects your learning progression.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Your Responsibility</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check in with instructors if you miss any course content</li>
                            <li>Remember that Monday's content is essential for Wednesday's work</li>
                            <li>Note that patterns of absences may affect your semester grade case</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Excused Absences</h3>
                        <p>Our policy aligns with TCU's non-penalizing approach to Official University Absences, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Title IX related issues</li>
                            <li>Military leave</li>
                            <li>Religious holy days</li>
                            <li>University-related absences</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Please let us know in advance</strong> if you anticipate being absent, late, or leaving early!</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Late Work Policy -->
                    <div class="policy-section">
                        <h2>‚è∞ Late Work</h2>
                        <p>We prefer not to allow late work because it limits our ability to provide timely feedback. However, we don't deduct points for late work under our un-grading system.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Extensions</h3>
                        <p><strong>Contact us before the assignment is due</strong> if you need an extension. We're typically happy to provide one, but patterns of late work may affect your semester grade case.</p>

                        <h3>Expected Behavior</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Follow rules of common courtesy in person and digitally</li>
                            <li>Maintain respectful communication in emails and discussions</li>
                            <li>Engage actively in class participation</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Recording Policy</h3>
                        <p><strong>Audio, video, or screen recording is prohibited</strong> and can result in a failing grade and suspension of University Computing Resources access. Students are also prohibited from sharing course materials without written instructor permission.</p>
                        
                        <p><em>Students with accommodations for audio recordings should contact instructors immediately and review Student Access and Accommodation policies.</em></p>

                        <p>Learning any new skill requires active engagement. Class participation is a critical component of this course.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why Participation Matters</h3>
                        <p>While some lecture is necessary, most learning comes from lively discussion and a degree of daring and play. Get involved early and often‚Äîthe class will surpass expectations if you do!</p>
