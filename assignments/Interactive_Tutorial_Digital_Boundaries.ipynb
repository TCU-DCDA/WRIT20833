    "## Conclusion: Sacred Boundaries in Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this tutorial, we've seen how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **String methods enforce digital boundaries** - `.lower()`, `.find()`, `len()`, and slicing help us validate and protect data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variables store our digital sacred objects** - passwords, emails, and sensitive data get the same protection as ancient totems\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conditional logic creates modern taboos** - `if` statements decide who can access what, just like ancient social rules\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code automates boundary enforcement** - What once required human priests and social pressure now runs automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big question:** Now that you understand how code creates and enforces digital boundaries, how does this change your relationship with technology?\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you enter a password, you're participating in a modern ritual of boundary-making\n",
    "- When apps ask for permissions, they're negotiating access to your digital sacred spaces  \n",
    "- When you protect your phone with a lock screen, you're creating a digital taboo\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Every line of boundary-protection code embeds someone's values about what should be protected and who should have access. The question is: will you help write those boundaries, or just live within the ones others create?\n",
