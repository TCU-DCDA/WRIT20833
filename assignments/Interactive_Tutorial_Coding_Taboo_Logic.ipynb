    "## Introduction: The Logic of the Sacred\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous discussions, we explored how ancient taboo systems created boundaries around the sacredâ€”determining who could enter temples, touch certain objects, or participate in rituals. Today, we'll see how this same boundary-making logic operates in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this ancient logic:\n",
    "```\n",
    "IF person is ritually pure\n",
    "THEN allow temple entry\n",
    "ELSE deny access\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider this modern equivalent:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if credit_score >= 700:\n",
    "    approve_loan()\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    deny_loan()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both systems:\n",
    "- Create **categories** that define people\n",
    "- Establish **thresholds** for access\n",
    "- Automate **boundary enforcement**\n",
    "- Embed **social values** in seemingly neutral rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference? Ancient boundary-making required human interpretation. Digital boundary-making runs automatically, at scale, often invisibly."
