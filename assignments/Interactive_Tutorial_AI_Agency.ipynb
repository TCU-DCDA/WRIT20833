    "\n",
    "Through this tutorial, we've explored the difference between:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎭 **Ventriloquism** (AI speaks through you):\n",
    "- You get code that works but don't understand how\n",
    "- You can't modify it when requirements change\n",
    "- You're helpless when it breaks\n",
    "- You become dependent on AI for every coding task\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗣️ **Learning a Language** (You speak computationally):\n",
    "- You understand what each piece does and why\n",
    "- You can adapt code for new situations\n",
    "- You can debug problems when they arise\n",
    "- You make informed choices about implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Computational Thinking Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "Using just the basics you've learned, you can:\n",
    "- **Read and analyze** AI-generated code\n",
    "- **Test edge cases** to find problems\n",
    "- **Improve and modify** existing code\n",
    "- **Replace black boxes** with concepts you understand\n",
    "- **Build from scratch** when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Central Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Are you learning to think computationally, or just outsourcing computational thinking?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have tools to answer this question. When you encounter AI-generated code, ask:\n",
    "- Can I explain each line?\n",
    "- Can I predict what happens with different inputs?\n",
    "- Can I modify this for new requirements?\n",
    "- Can I identify and replace the parts I don't understand?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option A: AI Ventriloquism**\n",
    "- Fast results, no understanding\n",
    "- Dependence on AI for every task\n",
    "- Hidden biases and assumptions\n",
    "- No agency when things go wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option B: AI as Scaffold**\n",
    "- AI helps with setup, you handle logic\n",
    "- You understand and can modify everything\n",
    "- You catch AI mistakes and biases\n",
    "- You maintain agency over the final product\n",
