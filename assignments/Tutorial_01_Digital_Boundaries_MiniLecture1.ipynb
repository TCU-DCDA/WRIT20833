    "## Introduction: From Sacred to Digital\n",
    "\n",
    "In Mini-Lecture 1, we explored how the Polynesian chief's shadow was protected like our biometric data today. Both create boundaries around what's considered \"sacred\" or \"private.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll practice basic Python concepts while exploring how code enforces digital boundaries. You'll use:\n",
    "- **Variables** - to store information\n",
    "- **String methods** - to manipulate and check text\n",
    "- **Conditionals (if/else)** - to make decisions\n",
    "- **Basic loops** - to check multiple items\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:\n",
    "1. How to use string methods to validate passwords\n",
    "2. How to protect email addresses from exposure\n",
    "3. How to classify data like ancient taboo systems\n",
    "4. How coding decisions create digital power structures"

    "## Assumptions/Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you have completed the following chapters from Melanie Walsh's [Introduction to Cultural Analytics](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Python Knowledge:\n",
    "- **Variables** (Chapter 4): Variable assignment (`=`), naming conventions, re-assignment\n",
    "- **Data Types** (Chapter 5): Understanding strings, integers, floats, booleans; using `type()` function\n",
    "- **String Methods** (Chapter 6): `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.replace()`, string indexing/slicing, `in` operator\n",
    "- **Comparisons & Conditionals** (Chapter 8): `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`; `if`/`elif`/`else` statements; `and`/`or` operators\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts You'll Practice:\n",
    "- Creating and manipulating string variables\n",
    "- Using conditional statements to make decisions\n",
    "- Applying string methods to analyze and transform text\n",
    "- Understanding how code creates boundaries and classifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You DON'T Need:\n",
    "- Functions (we'll use only built-in operations)\n",
    "- Lists and loops (covered in later chapters)\n",
    "- File handling or advanced programming concepts\n",

    "## Conclusion: Digital Boundaries and Power\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this tutorial, you've practiced basic Python concepts while exploring how code creates and enforces digital boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **Technical Skills You've Practiced:**\n",
    "- **String methods**: `.lower()`, `.find()`, `in` operator, slicing\n",
    "- **Conditionals**: `if/elif/else` for making decisions\n",
    "- **Variables**: storing and manipulating data\n",
    "- **Loops**: checking multiple items with `for` loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏛️ **Critical Connections You've Explored:**\n",
    "- **Ancient → Modern**: Sacred taboos → Password requirements\n",
    "- **Sacred Names → Protected Emails**: Hiding power from exposure\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Access → Role-Based Systems**: Who gets to enter sacred space\n",
    "- **Classification Systems → Data Privacy**: Creating digital taboo hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 **Questions to Keep Thinking About:**\n",
    "- Who decides what counts as \"sacred\" in digital systems?\n",
    "- How do these boundaries create or reinforce power structures?\n",
    "- What assumptions are built into the classification logic we wrote?\n",
    "- How might different cultures classify digital sacredness differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 **The Through-Line: Code as Boundary Enforcement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as ancient societies used rituals and taboos to create and maintain social boundaries, modern digital systems use code to create and maintain digital boundaries. The difference is that **code is faster, more consistent, and often invisible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write conditional statements like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if user_role == \"admin\":\n",
    "    # grant access\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # deny access\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You're not just writing instructions for a computer—you're encoding social rules about who has power and who doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Why This Matters for Your Field**\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're studying literature, history, religion, or any other humanities field, digital boundaries affect how you:\n",
    "- Access research materials\n",
    "- Share your work \n",
    "- Protect your intellectual property\n",
    "- Participate in digital scholarly communities\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how these boundaries work—and how to shape them—gives you agency in digital spaces rather than just being subject to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"The question is not whether digital boundaries should exist—it's who gets to draw them and how.\"*"

    "**Build on these concepts:**\n",
    "- Continue practicing string methods with your own data\n",

    "- Consider how AI might change these power dynamics (hint: that's Mini-Lecture 3!)\n",

    "- What happens when AI makes these boundary decisions?\n",
